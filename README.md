#JS Sketchpad

This exercise was provided by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/). My personal goal for completing it was to practice and improve my JavaScript / jQuery skills.</p>

The entire exercise took me ~1.5 hours from start to finish. I found it relatively easy, and am pleased with the end result. It was my first time using JavaScript and jQuery to create something original, and I truly learned a lot.

Instructions: Move your mouse over the grid to leave a colorful trail! Choose a different color on the bottom!

As an aside, it was also the first time I imported a custom Google Font into my file, as well as one of the first times I've comfortably imported an already-styled CSS3 button.
